If you want to use one of the predefined turbobuilder docker multi containers,
simply create a multicontainer.txt file inside this folder and write inside the name for the multi container to use. For example:

php7.4-apache2.4-mariadb10.4


Docker multi container names can be found at the turbobilder-node repository:

    src/main/resources/docker-multi-containers
    
If yow want to use your own docker multi container, remove the multicontainer.txt file and copy the multi container files into this folder, then modify it to your taste.

Turbobuilder will autodetect your custom multi container and run it instead of the predefined one.
