# TurboDepot

## General purpose multi storage library

This library gives you total control over your application storage requirements: Anything you may need to store as part of your application development is managed in a super easy and centralized way. It is also designed to be cross language: Several versions like Php or Node are implemented with exactly the same features, APIs and classes. Just like all the other components of the turboframework platform: Super reusable and cross language. Learn once, code forever!

### Features

- Super easy ORM: Save, read, list, filter and manipulate you application objects without caring about writing complex SQL queries (you can still execute plain SQL if necessary).
- Write and read to log files and manage their lifetime and space usage.
- Save, read, list and manage users, their permissions, tokens and security checks.
- All the storage configurations are centralized on a single json setup file. Everything you need to tweak is there.
- All the stored database or file system elements are saved in a human readable way, so you can still easily manipulate them outside of this library when needed.
- Easy but still powerful: Tested with massive amounts of stored objects
